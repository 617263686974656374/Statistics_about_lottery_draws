# Statistics_about_lottery_draws
This Java program simulates the process of repeatedly playing a lottery game and tracks the frequency of each number drawn. The user is asked to input the number of times they wish to repeat their lottery draws. Each draw involves randomly selecting five numbers from a range of 1 to 45, similar to a typical lottery game.

The program uses two arrays: one to store the numbers of each individual draw and another to keep track of the frequency of each number across all draws. After completing the specified number of draws, the program then analyzes and displays the frequency of each number that appeared more than once, along with its percentage occurrence out of the total numbers drawn.
